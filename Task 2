The process of compiling and running Java programs using the JDK (Java Development Kit) and JVM (Java Virtual Machine). 
Let me summarize the main points:
 1.Compilation:
   Java source code (.java files) is compiled using the javac compiler, which is part of the JDK.
   The output of compilation is bytecode (.class files), not machine code.
 2.Execution:
   JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes Java bytecode.
   JVM loads .class files into memory through a component called the class loader.
   Bytecode verifier checks the validity of .class files to ensure they are not corrupt or malicious.
   JIT (Just-In-Time) or AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation may be used to optimize performance by converting bytecode to machine code during execution.
   Security Manager ensures the security of the Java runtime environment by enforcing security policies.
 3.Running Java Programs:
   To run a Java program, you need the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), which includes JVM.
   You execute the program using the java command followed by the class name (without the .class extension).
