TASK 1
** Nested if statement **
       A nested if statement is an if statement that is placed inside another if statement.
       This allows for multiple conditions to be evaluated sequentially, providing more complex decision-making capabilities.
Example:
 
class NestedIf
{
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 25;
    boolean isStudent = false;
   if (age >= 18) {
        System.out.println("You are an adult.");
        if (isStudent) {
            System.out.println("You are a student.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are not a student.");
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("You are a minor.");
    }
}
}
Output:
You are an adult.
You are not a student.


TASK 2

** When for loop becomes infinite **
   
  A for loop becomes infinite when its termination condition never evaluates to false. 
  This can happen if the termination condition is missing or if the loop's increment/decrement logic prevents the condition from being false.

Example:

class InfiniteForLoop
{
public static void main (String args[]){
                for(int i=10; i>0; i++){
                System.out.println("Hello");
   }
 }
}

OUTPUT:
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
